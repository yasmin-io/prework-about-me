      <p>
        Always had a fascination with IT & Gadgets. Whether that's robots, PC
        building, equipment. I started a begginers coding course and really
        enjoyed the little bit of front-end that I had learnt. I also want to
        build my own website for my work. This course is a good stepping stone
        into the career I want.
